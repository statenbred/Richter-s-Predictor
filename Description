Performance metric
We are predicting the level of damage from 1 to 3. The level of damage is an ordinal variable meaning that ordering is important. This can be viewed as a classification or an ordinal regression problem. (Ordinal regression is sometimes described as an problem somewhere in between classification and regression.)

To measure the performance of our algorithms, we'll use the F1 score which balances the precision and recall of a classifier. Traditionally, the F1 score is used to evaluate performance on a binary classifier, but since we have three possible labels we will use a variant called the micro averaged F1 score.

Fmicro=2⋅Pmicro⋅RmicroPmicro+Rmicro

where

Pmicro=∑3k=1TPk∑3k=1(TPk+FPk),  Rmicro=∑3k=1TPk∑3k=1(TPk+FNk)

and TP
 is True Positive, FP
 is False Positive, FN
 is False Negative, and k
 represents each class in 1,2,3
.

In Python, you can easily calculate this loss using sklearn.metrics.f1_score with the keyword argument average='micro'.
